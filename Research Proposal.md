## Introduction:

The ability to understand spoken language without audio cues, also known as lipreading, is an important skill for individuals with hearing impairments, and has potential applications in security, communication, and entertainment. Despite advances in computer vision and machine learning, current lipreading systems still struggle with accuracy and robustness, especially in real-world scenarios where lighting, orientation, and occlusion vary.

In recent years, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision tasks. CapsNets use a hierarchical and dynamic architecture that captures spatial relationships between different facial parts, such as the lips, teeth, and tongue, which are crucial for accurate lipreading. Additionally, CapsNets are more robust to variations in lighting, orientation, and occlusion, making them potentially useful in lipreading systems.

This research proposal aims to explore the potential benefits of CapsNets for machine lipreading, by investigating their effectiveness in detecting subtle changes in lip movements that correspond to spoken words, without audio cues. The proposed research will contribute to the development of more accurate and robust lipreading systems, and potentially improve communication and quality of life for individuals with hearing impairments.


## Literature Review

### Overview of the field of machine lipreading

Lipreading, also known as speechreading, is the ability to understand spoken language by observing the movements of the speaker's lips, tongue, teeth, and other facial features. Lipreading is an important skill for individuals with hearing impairments, and has potential applications in security, communication, and entertainment. However, lipreading is a challenging task, as the movements of the lips are highly variable and influenced by factors such as lighting, orientation, and occlusion.

### Current approaches and limitations in lipreading systems

Current lipreading systems use a combination of computer vision techniques, such as optical flow analysis and deep learning models, to recognize speech from visual cues. However, these systems still struggle with accuracy and robustness, especially in real-world scenarios where lighting, orientation, and occlusion vary. Additionally, lipreading systems require large amounts of labeled data for training, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain.

### The potential benefits of CapsNets for machine lipreading

Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are a relatively new type of deep learning model that have shown promise in computer vision tasks, including object recognition and pose estimation. CapsNets use a hierarchical and dynamic architecture that captures spatial relationships between different parts of an object, such as the lips, teeth, and tongue, which are crucial for accurate lipreading. Additionally, CapsNets are more robust to variations in lighting, orientation, and occlusion, making them potentially useful in lipreading systems.

### Previous studies on CapsNets in computer vision tasks

Previous studies have shown that CapsNets can outperform traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in several computer vision tasks, such as object recognition and pose estimation. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of CapsNets in lipreading tasks. The proposed research aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the potential benefits of CapsNets for machine lipreading.
