# Introduction

Machine lipreading is a challenging task that involves recognizing speech from the movements of the speaker's lips, without relying on audio input. While humans can perform this task with remarkable accuracy, machine lipreading has traditionally been difficult to achieve due to the high variability in lip movements, the effects of lighting, occlusions, and the lack of context that audio provides. 
#
Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of more sophisticated models that can handle these challenges more effectively. In particular, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have shown promise for improving the accuracy of machine lipreading. CapsNets are a novel type of neural network architecture that use "capsules" to represent features in a more flexible and robust way than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
#
The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate the use of Capsule Networks for machine lipreading, with the aim of improving accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we will address the following research questions:
#
- How can Capsule Networks be adapted for machine lipreading tasks?
- How do Capsule Networks compare to traditional machine lipreading approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of using Capsule Networks for machine lipreading, and what are the implications for future research in this area?

To achieve these objectives, we will conduct experiments using a dataset of audio-visual recordings of speakers uttering sentences in different contexts. We will compare the performance of CapsNets with traditional machine lipreading approaches, and evaluate the robustness of the models to variations in lighting, occlusions, and speaker identity.

This thesis is structured as follows. In the next section, we review the relevant literature on machine lipreading and Capsule Networks. We then describe the methodology and approach used in our experiments, including the dataset, the CapsNet architecture, and the evaluation metrics. We present our results in the subsequent section, followed by a discussion of their implications for future research. We conclude the thesis with a summary of our key findings and recommendations for future work.
