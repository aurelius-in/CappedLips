# The above code downloads the OuluVS2 dataset from the specified 
# URL and saves it to the file path specified. It then uses the 
# zipfile library to extract the files from the downloaded archive.

# Note that the above code assumes that you are running it in a directory 
# where you have write permissions and where you want to download the dataset. 
# You can modify the file_path variable to save the downloaded file to a different directory. 
# Also, note that the downloaded file is in .zip format, so we need to use the zipfile 
# library to extract the files.

# set the URL and file path
