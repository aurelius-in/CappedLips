# The code uses the urllib.request library to download the dataset from the 
# URL specified, and saves it to the file path specified. It then uses the 
# tarfile library to extract the files from the downloaded archive.

# The code assumes that you are running it in a directory where you have write 
# permissions and where you want to download the dataset. You can modify the 
# file_path variable to save the downloaded file to a different directory.

# set the URL and file path
